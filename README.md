## Description


This project aims to provide a solution for converting the transactions report generated by Vanguard's custom report builder into the Sharepad format for import. By utilising this tool, users will be able to seamlessly transfer their investment transaction data from Vanguard to Sharepad, simplifying the process and saving time. The tool will handle the necessary data transformation and formatting, ensuring compatibility between the two platforms.

## Installation & Use

1. Export a CSV file from Vanguard's custom report builder and save it to the data folder. The file should be named `LoadDocstore.xlsx`.

2. Install the packages in requirements.txt

3. Run extract_script.py as a terminal and the file for Sharepad will be generated in the export folder called 'export.csv'

4. Import the 'export.csv' file into Sharepad

5. You will need to match the SharepadID from the export file to your investments in Sharepad. This will be part of the import wizard because unfortunately,  Vanguard doesn't include the ISIN or Ticker in the export file.

## Contributing

Please feel free to contribute. I have only tested with my relatively simple portfolio so there may be edge cases that I haven't considered.
